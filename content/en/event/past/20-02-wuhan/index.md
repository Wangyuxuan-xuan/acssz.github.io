When the coronavirus outbreak began in Wuhan, a city in central China, the Chinese in Zurich had Wuhan in their hearts. The Zurich Federation of Students has actively cooperated with relevant associations in Germany and other student federations in Switzerland to set up Wuhan Materials Support Association. At the same time, the Federation conveyed to the Chinese in Switzerland the latest epidemic policy issued by the Chinese Consulate in Zurich and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the local regulations on epidemic prevention and the repatriation policy and other important information.
